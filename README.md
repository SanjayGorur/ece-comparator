<br>

Comparator is a system I built in order to help decide which class is the hardest in the ECE curriculum at UT. This is a system that works using pairwise comparisons and ELO. In the background every vote affects the overall ELO of the course using the Glicko2 algorithm. With every vote, we become a little more sure of the subjective difficulty of these courses.
